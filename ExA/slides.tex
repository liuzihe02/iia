\section{Problem - Subsea Cable Inspection}

\begin{frame}{Problem - Why Subsea Cables Matter}
  \begin{columns}[T]
    \begin{column}{0.45\textwidth}
      \textbf{Backbone of the Internet:}
      \begin{itemize}
        \item 97-99\% of intercontinental data traffic
        \item 500+ cables worldwide
        \item 14 million kilometers total
        \item 2-5 cm diameter (garden hose size)
      \end{itemize}
    \end{column}
    \begin{column}{0.52\textwidth}
      \includegraphics[width=\textwidth]{img/subsea_cables.png}
    \end{column}
  \end{columns}

  \note{Before we dive into our design and feasibility assessment, let's give some context to the problem we're tackling: Subsea cables. Your internet connection, whether that be for online banking or video calls, 97-99\% of that data goes through a dense network of over 500+ undersea cables, spanning a total of 14 million kilometers over the seafloor making it THE largest and possibly greatest man-made infrastructure ever. This is the backbone of the internet, and when they fail, the consequences are severe. Despite the significance of these cables, these cables are no thicker than your average garden-hose around 2-5 cm in diameter, with hair-thin strands of optical fiber embedded within, designed to remain undisturbed across the seabed.}

      \textbf{Cable Faults:}
      \begin{itemize}
        \item ~200 faults/year
        \item Shallow waters most vulnerable
        \item Shetland Islands 2022: 23,000 people offline
      \end{itemize}

        \item[+] Unlimited power
        \item[+] Real-time comms
        \item[--] Limited range

  \textit{Solution: Free-roving Autonomous Underwater Vehicle}

  \note{In shallow waters however, these subsea cables are susceptible to a wider range of disturbances, largely from human activities such as anchoring, or snagged by nets, resulting in roughly 200 faults a year. In October 2022, both cables serving the Shetland Islands were damaged. For days, 23,000 people had no internet, could not use card payments, could not access online banking. Businesses lost thousands. Emergency services were disrupted. These are not rare events, they require constant monitoring and effective maintenance. When a fault occurs, an army of ships strategically placed around the world would identify and repair the location of the fault, which usually involves the usage of a tethered drone to inspect the damaged cable. Despite the effectiveness of tethered communications and unlimited power, this comes at the cost of a limited range of motion and risks of entanglement, as well as higher maintenance costs for dedicated vessels. Therefore we propose the use of an untethered AUV}

\section{Requirements and Operating Environment}

\begin{frame}{Requirements and Operating Environment}
  \textit{``A free-roving (no umbilical cable) submarine inspection drone is required for undersea cables: operating down to 250 m depth. It should have an endurance of 2 hours continuously powered operation, carrying video and ultrasound imaging equipment drawing a 30 W electrical load, and have suitable propulsion to travel up to 4 m/s peak speed with 1 m/s cruise. Total mass is to be $<$ 25 kg, to allow easy handling on board the mothership.''}

  \vspace{0.5em}

  \begin{columns}[T]
    \begin{column}{0.48\textwidth}
      \textbf{Key Specifications:}
      \begin{itemize}
        \item Depth: 250m (25 bar pressure)
        \item Endurance: 2 hours continuous
        \item Speed: 1 m/s cruise, 4 m/s peak
        \item Payload: 30W (imaging + ultrasound + lighting)
        \item Mass: $<$ 25 kg total
      \end{itemize}
    \end{column}

    \begin{column}{0.48\textwidth}
      \textbf{Operating Challenges:}
      \begin{itemize}
        \item Pressure: $P = \rho gh \approx 25$ bar
        \item Temperature: ~4°C seawater
        \item No GPS/RF underwater
        \item Saltwater corrosion
        \item Turbid water (limited visibility)
      \end{itemize}
    \end{column}
  \end{columns}

  \note{At 250 m depth, the pressure is approximately 25 bar (2.5 MPa). This is calculated using P = rho g h, where rho is seawater density (1027 kg/m cubed), g is gravitational acceleration, and h is depth. The temperature is approximately 4 degrees Celsius. Materials must resist corrosion - we will use 316 stainless steel and anodized aluminum. Sensors must work in turbid water with near-zero visibility. Communications are limited to acoustic modems underwater since radio and GPS signals cannot penetrate seawater beyond a few meters. The 30W payload limit includes all imaging equipment (camera), ultrasound sensors, and lighting - this is a combined budget, not separate allocations.}

  Key finding: No commercial AUV $<$25 kg achieves 4 m/s sustained speed

  \note{Many commercial solutions exist but vary in capability. Commercial designs such as the Iver3 and ecoSUB use fully autonomous operation with single thruster plus fins for pitch/yaw control. The Boxfish uses 8 vectored thrusters for full 6-DOF control including hovering. BlueROV2 is included as it is a Blue Robotics reference platform that proves component viability, though it is a tethered ROV not an autonomous AUV. Key finding: Few commercial AUVs under 25 kg achieve 4 m/s sustained speed - most operate at 1.5-2.5 m/s due to power limitations. Commercial pricing (50-150K dollars) reflects support and warranty, not just hardware costs. Our target specifications are ambitious but achievable with careful trade-off management.}

  \small Modular architecture enables phased development and testing

  \note{This simplified system architecture shows the five main subsystems. POWER provides 799 Wh from three 18Ah lithium-ion batteries at 14.8V. CONTROL uses the Navigator flight controller with dual IMUs plus Raspberry Pi 4 running ArduSub for mission control, along with depth sensor, compass, and surface GPS. PROPULSION consists of four T200 thrusters controlled by ESCs. PAYLOAD includes camera, Ping360 sonar, and lights totaling 30W. COMMUNICATIONS uses WiFi for high-bandwidth surface data transfer and Iridium satellite for position reporting, with optional acoustic modem for underwater comms. This modular design allows independent testing and phased development.}

\section{Communications and Navigation}

\begin{frame}{Underwater Communication Challenges}
  \textbf{Underwater Communication:}
  \begin{itemize}
    \item High signal attenuation limits the usage of radio frequency signals - effective range only a few metres
    \item Optical communication limited by turbidity and scattering - short range, line-of-sight only
    \item Acoustic communication is the only viable option for long-range underwater comms, but inherently slow, high latency, and affected by multipath
  \end{itemize}

  \vspace{0.5em}

  \textbf{Result:} Minimise communication — majority of data stored on the vehicle, only allowing small and simple commands to be communicated.
\end{frame}

      \bottomrule
    \end{tabular}
  \end{table}

  \vspace{0.5em}

  \textbf{Navigation Strategy:}
  IMU dead reckoning + depth + compass (5-15m drift/2hrs)

  \note{
    The Navigator flight controller contains dual IMUs - the ICM-42688-P and ICM-20602. Dual IMUs provide redundancy and enable sensor fusion, which reduces noise and compensates for drift in individual sensors.

    The Bar30 depth sensor provides 2 millimeter resolution by measuring pressure. At 250 meters depth, pressure is 25 bar. This gives accurate vertical positioning.

    For horizontal positioning, GPS signals cannot penetrate seawater. The system uses dead reckoning - integrating accelerometer measurements to estimate position. Small measurement errors accumulate over time, resulting in 5 to 15 meters of horizontal drift over the 2-hour mission.

    A DVL would reduce this drift to under 1 meter, but costs 5,000 to 20,000 dollars. For cable inspection, the cable itself provides a visual reference for following, so precise dead reckoning is less critical. We omit the DVL to reduce cost and weight.

  \vspace{0.5em}

  \textbf{Operational Modes:}
  \begin{itemize}
    \item \textbf{At surface:} WiFi for high-bandwidth video/data + GPS fix
    \item \textbf{Open ocean:} RockBLOCK for GPS position reporting every 10 min
  \end{itemize}

  \note{
    The communication system costs 310 dollars total: 50 dollars for WiFi and 260 dollars for RockBLOCK Iridium modem. This is 40 times cheaper than underwater acoustic modems at 12,000 to 15,000 dollars.

    At the surface within 50 to 100 meters of the mothership, WiFi provides 150 megabits per second bandwidth for downloading video and sensor data. The vehicle also acquires GPS fixes to reset navigation drift.

    For open ocean operations beyond visual range, the RockBLOCK uses the Iridium satellite network with global coverage. Every 10 minutes, the vehicle surfaces and transmits 340-byte messages containing GPS coordinates and status. This ensures vehicle recovery even kilometers from the mothership.

    The autonomous mission profile eliminates the need for real-time underwater communication. The vehicle follows pre-programmed waypoints, stores all sensor data onboard, and downloads it during surface intervals.

\begin{frame}{Underwater Acoustic Link Budget}
  \textbf{Acoustic Communication Constraints:}

  Transmission Loss: $TL = 20\log_{10}(R) + \alpha R \times 10^{-3}$ dB

  Where: $R$ = range (m), $\alpha$ = absorption coefficient (~3 dB/km @ 25 kHz)

  \vspace{1em}

  \textbf{Link Budget Calculation for R = 500m:}
  \begin{itemize}
    \item Transmission loss: $TL = 20\log_{10}(500) + 3 \times 0.5 = 54 + 1.5 = 55.5$ dB
    \item Source level: 180 dB re 1 $\mu$Pa @ 1m (EvoLogics modem)
    \item Array gain: 10 dB
    \item Received level: $180 - 55.5 + 10 = 134.5$ dB
    \item Noise level: 60 dB (sea state 3)
    \item Required SNR: 10 dB
    \item Link margin: $134.5 - 60 - 10 = 64.5$ dB - \textbf{Feasible}
  \end{itemize}

  \vspace{0.5em}

  \textbf{Result:} Acoustic communication feasible at 500m range with excellent margin

  \note{
    This link budget calculation demonstrates that underwater acoustic communication is technically feasible, though we omit it for cost reasons.

    Transmission loss has two components: spreading loss at 20 log R from geometric spreading, and absorption loss alpha times R. At 25 kilohertz, seawater absorption is approximately 3 decibels per kilometer, giving 1.5 decibels absorption at 500 meters.

    The calculation: EvoLogics modem source level is 180 decibels re 1 micropascal at 1 meter. After 500 meters, transmission loss is 55.5 decibels. Array gain adds 10 decibels. Received signal level is 134.5 decibels.

    Ocean ambient noise at sea state 3 is 60 decibels. Required signal-to-noise ratio for reliable communication is 10 decibels, meaning minimum received level of 70 decibels. The link margin is 64.5 decibels, sufficient to handle multipath interference and unexpected losses.

    Acoustic communication is feasible at 500 meter range with good performance margin. However, the 12,000 dollar cost is not justified for autonomous missions with periodic surfacing.

  \end{itemize}

  \textbf{Drag Force Equation:}
  $$F_D = \frac{1}{2} \rho v^2 C_D A$$

  Where $\rho = 1027$ kg/m$^3$ (seawater)

  \vspace{0.5em}

  \begin{itemize}
    \item \textbf{At 1 m/s cruise} $C_D = 0.32$: $F_D = 11.6$ N
    \item \textbf{At 4 m/s peak} $C_D = 0.28$: $F_D = 162$ N
  \end{itemize}

  \note{
    Hydrodynamic drag is the fundamental constraint on our design. The drag equation F-D equals one-half rho v-squared C-D A shows that drag force scales with velocity squared. Doubling speed quadruples drag force.

    Vehicle geometry is torpedo-shaped: 1.2 meters long, 0.3 meters diameter. The length-to-diameter ratio of 4 to 1 optimizes streamlining. Frontal area is 0.071 square meters.

    Drag coefficient C-D varies from 0.28 to 0.32 with speed. At low speeds, flow separation and turbulence near protrusions increases C-D to 0.32. At high speeds, Reynolds number increases, boundary layer becomes thinner, and C-D drops to 0.28. These values are validated against CFD studies on similar torpedo-shaped AUVs.

    At 1 meter per second, drag is 11.6 newtons. At 4 meters per second, drag is 162 newtons - a 14-fold increase for 4-times speed increase. This quadratic relationship creates the fundamental challenge: high speed requires overcoming dramatically higher drag forces.

  \textit{4 m/s requires 1.2 kW propulsion power (30× cruise power)}

  \note{
    Power scales with velocity cubed because power equals force times velocity. Drag force has v-squared, multiplied by another v from the power equation gives v-cubed scaling.

    Thruster efficiency varies with load. At 1 meter per second, mechanical power required is 11.6 watts, but thruster efficiency at light load is only 30 percent, requiring 39 watts electrical.

    At 4 meters per second, mechanical power is 648 watts - 56 times cruise. At heavy load, thruster efficiency increases to 55 percent, so electrical power is 1,178 watts.

    The critical number: 1,178 watts propulsion at peak versus 39 watts at cruise. This is 30 times more power for 4 times speed. Pure v-cubed scaling would give 64 times, but efficiency improvement at high load reduces this to 30 times.

    This cubic scaling makes sustained high-speed underwater operation challenging. The constraint is battery energy, which translates directly to weight. Battery energy requirements conflict with the 25 kilogram mass limit.

    The T200 uses flooded brushless motor design, which is naturally pressure-tolerant with no sealed air cavities. Tested to 3000 meters at Woods Hole, exceeding the 300 meter official rating and our 250 meter requirement.

Titanium Grade 5 has 880 megapascals yield strength but costs 30 dollars per kilogram versus 7 dollars for aluminum. Titanium is unnecessary for 250 meter depth - its advantage only matters beyond 1000 meters. Acrylic has only 70 to 75 megapascals yield strength, insufficient for 250 meter external pressure.

    Blue Robotics 3 inch aluminum enclosures were selected. Internal diameter is 74.7 millimeters, rated to 500 meters depth - twice the required safety margin. Hard anodizing provides corrosion resistance. Double O-ring seals ensure watertight integrity. Available lengths from 150 to 400 millimeters enable modular layout.

    WetLink penetrators provide cable entry at 12 to 17 dollars per unit, rated to 1000 meters. These are tool-free, reusable, and significantly cheaper than traditional potted penetrators. Complete enclosures cost 200 to 300 dollars. Thousands deployed in BlueROV2 fleet validate reliability.

\begin{frame}{Pressure Vessel Design - Theory}
  \textbf{Basic Thin-Walled Cylinder Theory}

  For external pressure $P$ on cylinder with radius $R$ and wall thickness $t$:

  $$\text{Hoop stress: } \sigma_\theta = \frac{P \cdot R}{t}$$

  \vspace{0.5em}

  \textbf{Apply Safety Criteria}

  Stress must not exceed allowable stress $S$ (with weld efficiency $E$):
  $$\sigma_\theta \leq S \cdot E$$

  $$\frac{P \cdot R}{t} \leq S \cdot E \quad \Rightarrow \quad t \geq \frac{P \cdot R}{S \cdot E}$$

  \vspace{0.5em}

  \textbf{ASME Section VIII Refinements}

  \begin{itemize}
    \item Add biaxial stress correction: denominator becomes $(S \cdot E - 0.6P)$
    \item Add corrosion allowance: $+C_A$ term
  \end{itemize}

  $$\boxed{t = \frac{P \cdot R}{S \cdot E - 0.6P} + C_A}$$

  \note{
    Pressure vessel design starts from thin-walled cylinder theory. Hoop stress equals P R over t from force balance on a cylinder element. This stress must not exceed allowable stress S times weld efficiency E.

    Rearranging gives minimum thickness t greater than or equal to P R over S E. This is the basic thin-wall formula.

    ASME Section VIII adds two refinements. First, the 0.6P biaxial stress correction in the denominator accounts for both circumferential and longitudinal stresses acting simultaneously. Second, corrosion allowance C-A is added for long-term durability in marine environments.

    The final formula is t equals P R over S E minus 0.6P, plus C-A. This is the standard for pressure vessel design under external pressure.

  \end{itemize}

  \vspace{0.5em}

  \textbf{ASME Section VIII Formula (External Pressure):}
  $$t = \frac{P \cdot R}{S \cdot E - 0.6P} + C_A = 6.3mm$$

  \begin{itemize}
    \item $P = 7.56$ MPa
    \item $R = 50$ mm (for 3" tube)
    \item $S = 92$ MPa (Al 6061-T6)

  \note{
    Operating pressure at 250 meters is rho g h equals 2.52 megapascals or 25.2 bar. With safety factor of 3, design pressure is 7.56 megapascals.

    Applying ASME Section VIII formula: P is 7.56 megapascals, R is 50 millimeters for 3 inch tube internal radius. Allowable stress S for aluminum 6061-T6 is yield strength divided by 3, giving 92 megapascals. Weld efficiency E is 1.0 for seamless tube. Corrosion allowance C-A is 2 millimeters for marine environment.

    Calculation gives t equals 7.56 times 50, over 92 times 1.0 minus 0.6 times 7.56, plus 2. This equals 378 divided by 87.5, plus 2, giving 4.3 plus 2 equals 6.3 millimeters minimum thickness.

\begin{frame}{Buoyancy and Ballast Design}
  \textbf{Neutral Buoyancy Requirement:}

  For dry mass $m = 15.4$ kg (calculated later) in seawater:
  $$V_{displaced} = \frac{m}{\rho} = \frac{15.4}{1027} = 0.015 \text{ m}^3 = 15.0 \text{ L}$$

  \vspace{1em}

  \textbf{Component Volumes and Buoyancy:}
  \begin{itemize}
    \item Pressure housings (3× 3" tubes): ~4 L (watertight)
    \item Batteries (internal to housing): ~2 L
    \item Thrusters: Negative buoyancy (~0.24 kg each × 4 = 0.96 kg)
    \item Electronics: Neutral (in watertight housings)
  \end{itemize}

  \note{
    Neutral buoyancy requires displaced volume equal to mass divided by seawater density. For dry mass of 15.4 kilograms, required displaced volume is 15.4 divided by 1027, equals 0.015 cubic meters or 15 liters.

    Component contributions: Three 3 inch aluminum tubes displace approximately 4 liters as watertight volumes. Batteries inside housings occupy approximately 2 liters. Electronics in watertight housings are approximately neutral buoyancy.

    Thrusters have negative buoyancy: each T200 is 0.24 kilograms negative in water, giving 0.96 kilograms total for four thrusters. This must be compensated with syntactic foam providing positive buoyancy.

    Final buoyancy adjustment uses lead weights for fine trim, positioning center of gravity below center of buoyancy to ensure passive stability in roll and pitch.

  \note{
    \textbf{(Mass Details)}
    The mass budget shows the AUV will weigh approximately 15.7 kg, well under the 25 kg limit with 37 percent margin. The largest contributors are the structure (35 percent including frame, syntactic foam for buoyancy, and streamlined fairings) and power system (29 percent for three 18Ah batteries). This substantial margin allows for future additions like a DVL (approximately 3 kg) or acoustic modem (approximately 1.5 kg) without exceeding the weight limit.

    \textbf{(Cost Details)}
    The estimated build cost of 10,840 dollars represents 20-25 percent of comparable commercial AUV systems (50-150K range). The Ping360 sonar is the single most expensive component at 2,750 dollars. Optional additions like the EvoLogics acoustic modem (12K) or Nortek DVL (20K) would increase total cost but are not required for basic cable inspection missions. The design prioritizes COTS components to minimize cost while maintaining technical performance.

  \note{
    All requirements have been met. Mass is 15.7 kilograms, 37 percent under the 25 kilogram limit. Endurance is 2.5 hours with 80/20 mission profile, exceeding 2 hour requirement. Cruise speed of 1 meter per second is achievable with 39 watts propulsion. Peak speed of 4 meters per second is achievable with 1,178 watts propulsion and 200 newtons total thrust. Payload power is 30 watts total for camera, sonar, and lighting.

    The key enabler is the mission profile approach: 80 percent time at 1 meter per second cruise, 20 percent at 4 meters per second sprint. Sustained 4 meters per second operation would require 2,450 watt-hours for 2 hours, exceeding weight constraints. The mixed profile reduces average power to 314 watts, making the design feasible.

\begin{frame}{Conclusions}

  \textbf{Critical Engineering Insights:}
  \begin{enumerate}
    \item \textbf{Power scales as $v^3$:} 4 m/s requires 30× more power than 1 m/s
    \item \textbf{Mission profile approach:} Mixed speed profile (80\% cruise) enables 2-hour endurance
    \item \textbf{Hydrodynamic optimization critical:} Low $C_D$ (0.28-0.32) essential for achieving 4 m/s
    \item \textbf{Component selection:} T200 thrusters offer best thrust-to-cost ratio (0.36-0.42)
  \end{enumerate}

  \begin{columns}[T]
    \begin{column}{0.48\textwidth}
      \textbf{Strengths:}
      \begin{itemize}
        \item COTS components (proven)
        \item 37\% mass margin
        \item 25\% endurance margin
        \item Modular design
      \end{itemize}
    \end{column}

    \begin{column}{0.48\textwidth}
      \textbf{Constraints:}
      \begin{itemize}
        \item 23\% thrust margin
        \item Low-drag hull required
        \item IMU drift without DVL
        \item Acoustic comms \$12K
      \end{itemize}
    \end{column}
  \end{columns}

  \note{
    The fundamental physics constraint is that power scales with velocity cubed. Drag force scales as v-squared from the drag equation, multiplied by v from power equals force times velocity, giving v-cubed. Going from 1 to 4 meters per second theoretically requires 64 times more power. Thruster efficiency variations reduce this to 30 times in practice.

    The mission profile approach is essential: operating primarily at cruise speed with brief sprints enables both 4 meters per second peak capability and 2 hour endurance within 25 kilogram weight limit. Sustained high speed is thermodynamically incompatible with the weight constraint.

    Hydrodynamic optimization is critical. Low drag coefficient of 0.28 to 0.32 is achieved through torpedo hull shape with 4 to 1 length-to-diameter ratio. Higher drag would require more thrust, more power, heavier batteries.

    Component selection focused on cost-effectiveness. T200 thrusters provide 0.38 newtons per dollar thrust-to-cost ratio, 6 to 20 times better than alternatives. COTS components from Blue Robotics ecosystem reduce integration risk and cost.

    The design is technically feasible with 23 percent thrust margin, 37 percent mass margin, and 25 percent endurance margin. Main constraint is the tight thrust margin - variation in drag coefficient from hull imperfections could eliminate margin.
