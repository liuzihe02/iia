\section{The Problem - Subsea Cable Inspection}

\begin{frame}{The Problem - Subsea Cable Inspection}
  \begin{itemize}
    \item Backbone of the modern internet infrastructure, carrying 97-99\% of all intercontinental data traffic.
    \item 500+ cables worldwide, a total of 14 million kilometers
    \item Around 2-5 cm in diameter,
  \end{itemize}

  \note{Before we dive into our design and feasibility assessment, let's give some context to the problem we're tackling: Subsea cables. Your internet connection, whether that be for online banking or video calls, 97-99\% of that data goes through a dense network of over 500+ undersea cables, spanning a total of 14 million kilometers over the seafloor making it THE largest and possible greatest man-made infrastructure ever. This is the backbone of the internet, and when they fail, the consequences are severe. Despite the significance of these cables, these cables are no thicker than your average garden-hose around 2-5 cm in diameter, with hair-thin strands of optical fibre embedded within, designed to remain undisturbed across the seabed.}
\end{frame}

\begin{frame}{The Problem - Subsea Cable Inspection}
  \begin{itemize}
    \item Averages 200 faults a year, particularly in shallow waters (~200m)
    \item Shetland Islands cutoff in 2022
    \item Traditional inspection methods use tethered ROVs, which can limit motion and increase cost
  \end{itemize}

  \note{In shallow waters however, these subsea cables are susceptible to a wider range of disturbances, largely from human activities such as anchoring, or snagged by nets, resulting in roughly 200 faults a year. In October 2022, both cables serving the Shetland Islands were damaged. For days, 23,000 people had no internet, couldn't use card payments, couldn't access online banking. Businesses lost thousands. Emergency services were disrupted. These aren't rare events, they require constant monitoring and effective maintenance. When a fault occurs, an army of ships strategically placed around the world would be able to identify and repair the location of the fault, which usually involves the usage of a tethered drone to inspect the damaged cable. Despite the effectiveness of tethered communications and unlimited power, this comes at the cost of a limited range of motion and risks of entanglement, as well as higher maintainence costs for dedicated vessels.}

\section{Problem Definition and Requirements}

\begin{frame}{Problem Definition}
  \textit{``A free-roving (no umbilical cable) submarine inspection drone is required for undersea cables: operating down to 250 m depth. It should have an endurance of 2 hours continuously powered operation, carrying video and ultrasound imaging equipment drawing a 30 W electrical load, and have suitable propulsion to travel up to 4 m/s peak speed with 1 m/s cruise. Total mass is to be < 25 kg, to allow easy handling on board the mothership.''}

  \vspace{1em}

  \textbf{Key Specifications:}
  \begin{itemize}
    \item \textbf{Depth:} 250m → 25 bar external pressure

\begin{frame}{Operating Environment}

  \note{At 250 m, pressure is roughly 25 bar and temperatures are low. Materials must resist corrosion, sensors must work in turbid water, and communications are limited to acoustic modems --- no radio or GPS below the surface.}

  \textbf{At 250m depth:}
  \begin{itemize}
    \item \textbf{Pressure:} $\rho gh = 1027 \times 9.81 \times 250 \approx 25$ bar (2.5 MPa)
    \item \textbf{Temperature:} ~4°C seawater
    \item \textbf{Visibility:} Limited to near-zero (turbid water). Not affected by surface wave currents driven by wind
    \item \textbf{Currents:} Minimal (below surface wave action)
  \end{itemize}

  \textbf{Material Challenges:}
  \begin{itemize}
    \item Saltwater corrosion (requires 316 stainless steel, anodized aluminum)
    \item Biofouling (marine growth on surfaces)

  \textbf{Communication Constraints:}
  \begin{itemize}
    \item No radio/GPS underwater (high attenuation)

  \note{Many consumer solutions already exist, however they vary in their degree of satisfying the requirements as stated previously.

Few commercial AUV <25 kg achieves 4 m/s sustained speed, most operate at 1.5-2.5 m/s}

\section{Technical Approach}

%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
\section{System Design and Architecture}

\begin{frame}{System Design}
  \begin{itemize}
    \item Autonomous/programmable solution to remove the need for high-quality real-time data transmission which limits untethered ROVs
    \item 8-thruster design for stability and hovering capabilities for detailed inspection
    \item Reinforced acrylic casing for
  \end{itemize}

  \note{Autonomous vs controlled: As per most consumer designs, we opted for an autonomous control system with simple programmable commands to eliminate the need for high-bandwidth data transmission such as live-video feedback underwater, which is technically difficult to achieve.

    Number of thruster choice: Initially, the most obvious choice was to use a single thruster with fins to control direction, however given the specific context of wire inspection, and with the slenderness of the wires in mind it became clear that we needed a more agile and controllable thruster layout. As such, a symmetrical 4 thrusters in to planes of motion are selected (x and y planes) to control pitch and yaw.

    This slide gives a high-level overview of our system design. At the core of the vehicle is a modular architecture that integrates five key subsystems: power, propulsion, navigation, payload, communication, and computing. We selected lithium-ion batteries for their high energy density and proven safety in marine environments --- this allows over two hours of continuous operation at 30 watts average load. The propulsion system uses four thrusters, giving stable control in pitch and yaw while maintaining low-speed precision for cable inspection. For navigation, the Teledyne RDI Doppler Velocity Log provides bottom-lock velocity measurements up to 81 meters from the seabed --- crucial since GPS isn't available underwater. A depth sensor and compass complement this for full-state estimation. The payload includes both video and ultrasonic imaging sensors to capture visual and subsurface views of the cable. Communication is handled via 802.11n Wi-Fi at the surface for high-rate data transfer, and optionally an acoustic modem for low-bandwidth command or telemetry while submerged. Finally, all subsystems are coordinated by an onboard embedded computer, which manages mission control and autonomy. This architecture gives us a balance between endurance, maneuverability, and data fidelity --- all within the 25 kg system mass limit.}

  \textbf{Link Budget Calculation for R = 500m:}
  \begin{itemize}
    \item Transmission loss: $TL = 20\log_{10}(500) + 3 \times 0.5 = 54 + 1.5 = 55.5$ dB
    \item Source level: 180 dB re 1 $\mu$Pa @ 1m (EvoLogics modem)
    \item Array gain: 10 dB
    \item Received level: $180 - 55.5 + 10 = 134.5$ dB
    \item Noise level: 60 dB (sea state 3)

\begin{frame}{Conclusions}
  \textbf{Technical Feasibility: CONFIRMED}

  \begin{itemize}
    \item All requirements met or exceeded (except tight 4 m/s margin)
    \item Commercial off-the-shelf components available
    \item Build cost \$10-23K vs \$50-150K commercial
    \item 37\% mass margin, 70\% endurance margin
  \end{itemize}

  \vspace{1em}

  \textbf{Key Findings:}
  \begin{enumerate}
    \item \textbf{Speed-endurance trade-off:} 4 m/s sustained not feasible for 2 hrs; mission profile approach required
    \item \textbf{Minimal thrust margin:} Hydrodynamic optimization (streamlining, low Cd) is critical
    \item \textbf{Cost-effective:} 20-25\% of commercial pricing with superior speed performance
    \item \textbf{Academic suitability:} Excellent multi-disciplinary engineering project

    \item 4× @ 18V: alternative using higher voltage (requires battery upgrade)
  \end{itemize}

  \textbf{Recommendation:} 4× T200 @ 16V with contingency for adding 5th thruster if testing shows insufficient thrust

  \textbf{Reynolds Number:} $Re = \frac{\rho v L}{\mu} = \frac{1027 \times v \times 1.2}{1.08 \times 10^{-3}}$

  \begin{itemize}
    \item @ 1 m/s: $Re = 1.14 \times 10^6$ (turbulent flow)
    \item @ 4 m/s: $Re = 4.56 \times 10^6$ (fully turbulent)
  \end{itemize}

  \textbf{Sensitivity:} If actual $C_D = 0.35$ (worst case), thrust required = 235 N → \textcolor{red}{deficit of 35 N}
