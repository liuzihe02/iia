\section{The Problem - Subsea Cable Inspection}

\begin{frame}{The Problem - Why Subsea Cables Matter}
  \begin{columns}[T]
    \begin{column}{0.45\textwidth}
      \textbf{Backbone of the Internet:}
      \begin{itemize}
        \item 97-99\% of intercontinental data traffic
        \item 500+ cables worldwide
        \item 14 million kilometers total
        \item 2-5 cm diameter (garden hose size)
      \end{itemize}
    \end{column}
    \begin{column}{0.52\textwidth}
      \includegraphics[width=\textwidth]{img/subsea_cables.png}
    \end{column}
  \end{columns}

  \note{Before we dive into our design and feasibility assessment, let's give some context to the problem we're tackling: Subsea cables. Your internet connection, whether that be for online banking or video calls, 97-99\% of that data goes through a dense network of over 500+ undersea cables, spanning a total of 14 million kilometers over the seafloor making it THE largest and possibly greatest man-made infrastructure ever. This is the backbone of the internet, and when they fail, the consequences are severe. Despite the significance of these cables, these cables are no thicker than your average garden-hose around 2-5 cm in diameter, with hair-thin strands of optical fiber embedded within, designed to remain undisturbed across the seabed.}

      \textbf{Cable Faults:}
      \begin{itemize}
        \item ~200 faults/year
        \item Shallow waters most vulnerable
        \item Shetland Islands 2022: 23,000 people offline
      \end{itemize}

      \begin{itemize}
        \item[+] Unlimited power
        \item[+] Real-time comms
        \item[--] Limited range

  \note{In shallow waters however, these subsea cables are susceptible to a wider range of disturbances, largely from human activities such as anchoring, or snagged by nets, resulting in roughly 200 faults a year. In October 2022, both cables serving the Shetland Islands were damaged. For days, 23,000 people had no internet, could not use card payments, could not access online banking. Businesses lost thousands. Emergency services were disrupted. These are not rare events, they require constant monitoring and effective maintenance. When a fault occurs, an army of ships strategically placed around the world would identify and repair the location of the fault, which usually involves the usage of a tethered drone to inspect the damaged cable. Despite the effectiveness of tethered communications and unlimited power, this comes at the cost of a limited range of motion and risks of entanglement, as well as higher maintenance costs for dedicated vessels. Therefore we propose the use of an untethered AUV}

\section{Requirements and Operating Environment}

\begin{frame}{Requirements and Operating Environment}
  \textit{``A free-roving (no umbilical cable) submarine inspection drone is required for undersea cables: operating down to 250 m depth. It should have an endurance of 2 hours continuously powered operation, carrying video and ultrasound imaging equipment drawing a 30 W electrical load, and have suitable propulsion to travel up to 4 m/s peak speed with 1 m/s cruise. Total mass is to be $<$ 25 kg, to allow easy handling on board the mothership.''}

  \vspace{0.5em}

  \begin{columns}[T]
    \begin{column}{0.48\textwidth}
      \textbf{Key Specifications:}
      \begin{itemize}
        \item Depth: 250m (25 bar pressure)
        \item Endurance: 2 hours continuous
        \item Speed: 1 m/s cruise, 4 m/s peak
        \item Payload: 30W (imaging + ultrasound + lighting)
        \item Mass: $<$ 25 kg total
      \end{itemize}
    \end{column}

    \begin{column}{0.48\textwidth}
      \textbf{Operating Challenges:}
      \begin{itemize}
        \item Pressure: $P = \rho gh \approx 25$ bar
        \item Temperature: ~4°C seawater
        \item No GPS/RF underwater
        \item Saltwater corrosion
        \item Turbid water (limited visibility)
      \end{itemize}
    \end{column}
  \end{columns}

  \note{At 250 m depth, the pressure is approximately 25 bar (2.5 MPa). This is calculated using P = rho g h, where rho is seawater density (1027 kg/m cubed), g is gravitational acceleration, and h is depth. The temperature is approximately 4 degrees Celsius. Materials must resist corrosion - we will use 316 stainless steel and anodized aluminum. Sensors must work in turbid water with near-zero visibility. Communications are limited to acoustic modems underwater since radio and GPS signals cannot penetrate seawater beyond a few meters. The 30W payload limit includes all imaging equipment (camera), ultrasound sensors, and lighting - this is a combined budget, not separate allocations.}

  Key finding: No commercial AUV $<$25 kg achieves 4 m/s sustained speed

  \note{Many commercial solutions exist but vary in capability. Commercial designs such as the Iver3 and ecoSUB use fully autonomous operation with single thruster plus fins for pitch/yaw control. The Boxfish uses 8 vectored thrusters for full 6-DOF control including hovering. BlueROV2 is included as it is a Blue Robotics reference platform that proves component viability, though it is a tethered ROV not an autonomous AUV. Key finding: Few commercial AUVs under 25 kg achieve 4 m/s sustained speed - most operate at 1.5-2.5 m/s due to power limitations. Commercial pricing (50-150K dollars) reflects support and warranty, not just hardware costs. Our target specifications are ambitious but achievable with careful trade-off management.}

  \small Modular architecture enables phased development and testing

  \note{This simplified system architecture shows the five main subsystems. POWER provides 799 Wh from three 18Ah lithium-ion batteries at 14.8V. CONTROL uses the Navigator flight controller with dual IMUs plus Raspberry Pi 4 running ArduSub for mission control, along with depth sensor, compass, and surface GPS. PROPULSION consists of four T200 thrusters controlled by ESCs. PAYLOAD includes camera, Ping360 sonar, and lights totaling 30W. COMMUNICATIONS uses WiFi for high-bandwidth surface data transfer and Iridium satellite for position reporting, with optional acoustic modem for underwater comms. This modular design allows independent testing and phased development.}

\section{Communications and Navigation}

\begin{frame}{Underwater Communication Challenges}
  \textbf{Underwater Communication:}
  \begin{itemize}
    \item High signal attenuation limits the usage of radio frequency signals - effective range only a few metres
    \item Optical communication limited by turbidity and scattering - short range, line-of-sight only
    \item Acoustic communication is the only viable option for long-range underwater comms, but inherently slow, high latency, and affected by multipath
  \end{itemize}

  \vspace{0.5em}

  \textbf{Result:} → Minimise communication — majority of data stored on the vehicle, only allowing small and simple commands to be communicated.

  \textbf{Navigation Strategy:}
  \begin{itemize}
    \item \textbf{Baseline:} IMU dead reckoning + depth + compass (5-15m drift/2hrs)
    \item \textbf{Enhanced:} + Cable visual tracking (reduces drift to $<$5m)
    \item \textbf{Premium (+\$20K):} Nortek DVL1000 (0.2 cm/s, $<$1m error/2hrs)
  \end{itemize}

  \note{
    The Navigator flight controller uses dual IMUs (ICM-42688-P and ICM-20602) for redundancy and sensor fusion. Dead reckoning integrates accelerometer data to estimate position, but accumulates drift over time (typically 5-15m over 2 hours). The Bar30 depth sensor provides accurate vertical positioning using a pressure sensor. For cable inspection missions, visual tracking of the cable provides an external reference that significantly reduces horizontal drift. The premium DVL (Doppler Velocity Log) option bounces acoustic pulses off the seafloor to measure velocity with 0.2 cm/s accuracy, virtually eliminating drift.

  \note{
    WiFi provides high-bandwidth communication when surfaced, enabling video download and mission updates. The RockBLOCK 9603N uses Iridium satellite network for global coverage - critical for open ocean operations where the AUV may surface far from the mother ship. It can transmit GPS coordinates and status messages (340 bytes). The optional EvoLogics acoustic modem enables underwater communication at up to 2 km range, useful for real-time monitoring during critical inspection phases. However, for cable-following missions with periodic surfacing, the acoustic modem is not essential, saving \$12K.

    \item Drag coefficient: $C_D = 0.28$-$0.32$ (optimized to standard torpedo hull)
  \end{itemize}

  \vspace{0.5em}

  \textbf{Drag Force Equation:}
  $$F_D = \frac{1}{2} \rho v^2 C_D A$$

  Where $\rho = 1027$ kg/m$^3$ (seawater)

  \vspace{0.5em}

  \textbf{Calculations:}
  \begin{itemize}
    \item \textbf{At 1 m/s cruise} ($C_D = 0.32$):
          $$F_D = \frac{1}{2} \times 1027 \times 1^2 \times 0.32 \times 0.0824 = \textbf{13.5 N}$$
    \item \textbf{At 4 m/s peak} ($C_D = 0.28$):
          $$F_D = \frac{1}{2} \times 1027 \times 16 \times 0.28 \times 0.0824 = \textbf{188 N}$$
  \end{itemize}

  \note{The drag force is calculated using the standard hydrodynamic equation. We assume a torpedo-shaped hull with length 1.2m and diameter 0.324m, giving a streamlined L/D ratio of 3.7. The frontal area is calculated from the circular cross-section. Drag coefficient varies with speed due to Reynolds number effects - at higher speeds the flow is more turbulent and the boundary layer thinner, slightly reducing drag coefficient from 0.32 to 0.28. These values are validated by CFD studies from MDPI and SCIRP papers on similar AUV geometries. At 1 m/s, drag is only 13.5 N, but at 4 m/s it increases to 188 N due to the quadratic relationship with velocity. This 14-fold increase in drag force is the fundamental challenge of achieving high speed.}

  \textcolor{red}{\textbf{Key finding:}} 4 m/s requires 1.4 kW propulsion power (30× cruise power!)

  \note{The mechanical power required is simply force times velocity (P = F × v). However, thrusters are not 100 percent efficient at converting electrical power to mechanical thrust power. The T200 thruster efficiency varies from about 30 percent at light loads to 55 percent at heavy loads. At 1 m/s cruise with only 13.5W mechanical power needed, the thruster operates inefficiently at 30 percent, requiring 45W electrical. At 4 m/s peak with 752W mechanical power, the thruster operates more efficiently at 55 percent, requiring 1,367W electrical. This table shows the dramatic increase: 4 m/s requires 30 times more electrical power than 1 m/s cruise. This quadratic-to-cubic scaling (drag proportional to v-squared, power proportional to v-cubed) is the fundamental thermodynamic reason why sustained high-speed operation is challenging within our weight and battery constraints.}

The Maxon MT30 has excellent performance and 6000m depth rating but costs 14-21 times more than the T200 - overkill for our 250m requirement. The T500 provides massive thrust (158N) but draws over 1kW continuously and is heavier. The T200 offers the best thrust-to-cost ratio at 0.36-0.42 N per dollar.

    The mass budget shows the AUV will weigh approximately 15.7 kg, well under the 25 kg limit with 37 percent margin. The largest contributors are the structure (35 percent including frame, syntactic foam for buoyancy, and streamlined fairings) and power system (29 percent for three 18Ah batteries). This substantial margin allows for future additions like a DVL (approximately 3 kg) or acoustic modem (approximately 1.5 kg) without exceeding the weight limit.

    (BlueROV2: \$3.5K but tethered ROV, not autonomous)
  \end{center}

  \note{
    The estimated build cost of 10,840 dollars represents 20-25 percent of comparable commercial AUV systems (50-150K range). The Ping360 sonar is the single most expensive component at 2,750 dollars. Optional additions like the EvoLogics acoustic modem (12K) or Nortek DVL (20K) would increase total cost but are not required for basic cable inspection missions. The design prioritizes COTS components to minimize cost while maintaining technical performance.

  \note{
    The key physics insight is that drag force scales with velocity squared (F = 0.5 × rho × v² × Cd × A), so power required scales with velocity cubed (P = F × v = v³). This means going from 1 m/s to 4 m/s requires 4³ = 64 times more power theoretically, though efficiency variations reduce this to about 18× in practice. The mission profile approach (operating mostly at cruise speed with brief sprints) is the only way to achieve both the 4 m/s peak speed requirement and 2-hour endurance with a $<$25 kg weight constraint. The design is technically feasible but requires careful hydrodynamic optimization to minimize drag coefficient.
