# ExA Task Requirements

The Feasibility Study tasks are akin to a professional consultancy activity where a client presents a technical challenge which they wish to have solved.  These may not even be achievable (in all aspects anyway) but rather reflect a desire for a specified performance – you have the opportunity in these tasks to have some fun and be creative (but still be sensible!) and you may make any reasonable assumptions about parameters not defined in the brief.

For the Feasibility Studies, you should aim to cover the following areas at least in outline:

- introduction to the design topic: describe parameters of the operating environment

- mention any existing commercial solutions, or things which are similar/related

- briefly discuss a couple of technical approaches

- key scoping calculations on the selected approach: covering things such as mechanics, environment, speeds, torques, signal levels, power budgets etc. relevant to the solution to justify that it could work

- schematic system design (block diagrams)

- details of key parts, e.g., datasheet extracts

- budgetary estimate

- summary / conclusions

## Problem Statement

> A free-roving (no umbilical cable) submarine inspection drone is required for undersea cables: operating down to 250 m depth. It should have an endurance of 2 hours continuously powered operation, carrying video and ultrasound imaging equipment drawing a 30 W electrical load, and have suitable propulsion to travel up to 4 m/s peak speed with 1 m/s cruise. 

> Total mass is to be < 25 kg, to allow easy handling on board the mother ship. 

> Key technical issues are electrical power and communications.

## Presentation Guidelines

Your objectives in making the presentation are to convey to the rest of the group an explanation of how the system you have been investigating works.

You should not detail all that you have covered, but it is desirable to describe (at least in outline) how you set about finding out (or confirming) what you are presenting about the workings of the system concerned.

It will be impossible to include all the details of the system, or of your investigations, in 10-15 minutes. Don't try.

Here are some suggestions to help you:

Tell a connected story (so your listeners can follow what you're saying).

Tend towards a 'top down' organisation in your presentation, so that your listeners start with an understanding of the overall goals of the system and the challenges faced in it’s design.

They can then put the details in context. If you start with lots of detail, your audience won't have a clue what their purpose is.

Make it interesting and comprehensible. Describe what's happening - don't include details that can't be explained by you (and absorbed by your listeners) in the short time available.

Don't fall into the trap of putting a line on a busy slide (complex equations are the worst) which needs a lot a time to explain it. You must have time to explain it, or at least to explain the only important things about it. If you don't have this time, delete it.

Rehearse. If you don't, you'll fall into the above trap; also the flow won't be so good.

Ask yourself 'does this bit really matter?'. If it doesn't, consider deleting it, or keep it in only because it's amusing or interesting.

It doesn't matter if you manage to say all that you think is interesting in less than the 10-15 minutes. In fact, it's fine.

Avoid animation in Powerpoint unless you really want the additional emphasis it brings.

State at least one conclusion!



Summary

A good short presentation is more difficult to give than a long one; it will have to focus on a significant angle regarding your topic and should not be just a summary of what you have done and discovered. You will have to prepare it with care, giving careful thought to what are the important things you need to say.

Also consider what is really likely to be of interest to your audience. Excessive technical detail is unlikely to be a good choice, whereas overviews combined with "black box" descriptions of processes are likely to be more informative for the audience. More minor or esoteric points should be included if they add interest, or answer an obvious question, but not just for the sake of completeness.
