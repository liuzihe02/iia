\subsection{Linear transformation of normal variables}
For normally distributed ${\cal N}(x|0,1)$ random variables, take $y=f(x)=ax+b$. Calculate $p(y)$ using the Jacobian formula:

\subsection{Verification of linear transformation}
Verify this formula by transforming a large collection of random samples $x^{(i)}$ to give $y^{(i)}=f(x^{(i)})$, histogramming the resulting $y$ samples, and overlaying a plot of your formula calculated using the Jacobian:
