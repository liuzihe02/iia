# Engineering Tripos Part IIA

Repository for labs and coursework for Engineering Tripos Part IIA

## Latex Workshop

We use [VSCode Latex Workshop](https://github.com/James-Yu/LaTeX-Workshop/wiki) to edit our latex documents. Please install this in VSCode as a drop-in local replacement for Overleaf.

Please keep the `.vscode/settings.json` file as this lays out how to build and clean latex properly.

- To build, simply *save* the latex file
- All build artefacts should be cleaned automatically, keeping only the pdf file in the relevant directory
- It may takes 2/3 seconds to compile and clean, so please be patient
